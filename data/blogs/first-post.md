Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to start sharing my journey as a software engineer, the projects I'm working on, and the lessons I'm learning along the way.

## Why I Started This Blog

As a recent Computer Science graduate from James Madison University, I've realized that documenting my learning process not only helps me retain knowledge but also allows me to give back to the developer community. Whether you're a fellow student, a seasoned developer, or someone curious about technology, I hope you'll find value in these posts.

Programming has been my passion since high school, when a game development course first introduced me to the foundations of coding. Since then, I've explored everything from low-level graphics programming to modern web development, and I want to share these experiences with you.

## What You Can Expect

I'll be covering a diverse range of topics that reflect my interests and current projects:

### üé® Graphics Programming & 3D Development
- Deep dives into WebGL and OpenGL
- Building rendering engines (like my current projects Lumina and Tiles)
- Shader development and optimization techniques
- Computer graphics theory and practical applications

### üåê Web Development
- React and Next.js best practices and lessons learned
- Full-stack application architecture
- Performance optimization techniques
- Modern JavaScript and TypeScript patterns

### üõ†Ô∏è DevOps & Infrastructure
- My journey learning Ansible, OpenShift, and RHEL
- Deployment strategies and automation
- Docker containerization experiences
- Cloud platform explorations

### üí≠ Personal Development & Career
- Lessons from my time at JMU and industry internships
- Transitioning from student to professional developer
- Project management and collaborative development
- Reflections on problem-solving approaches

## My Current Focus

Right now, I'm diving deep into 3D graphics programming while simultaneously expanding my web development skills. I'm also exploring the DevOps world through my role at Carahsoft, working with Red Hat technologies. Each of these areas presents unique challenges and learning opportunities that I'm excited to share.

## Let's Connect

I believe the best learning happens through community and discussion. If any of my posts spark questions, ideas, or differing perspectives, I'd love to hear from you. You can reach out through my contact page or connect with me on GitHub where I share my latest projects.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. I'm looking forward to sharing what I learn and hearing about your own experiences in the world of software development!
